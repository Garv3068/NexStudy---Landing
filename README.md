🧐 The Problem

Most AI study tools (like StudyX or Chegg) claim to be free but hit you with a "Daily Limit Reached" paywall after just 5 questions. As students, we can't afford $10/month subscriptions just to solve our homework.

💡 The Solution: NexStudy

NexStudy is an open-source, privacy-first alternative. instead of charging you, it connects directly to Google's Gemini API (which offers a generous free tier). This means you can bring your own API key and get unlimited, free access to powerful AI study tools.
